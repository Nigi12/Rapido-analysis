# Rapido-analysis
📊 Rapido data Analysis Project
✨ I built a Power BI dashboard to analyze Rapido’s bike-sharing and transport service performance in Bangalore for 2024. The goal was to uncover customer trends, demand patterns, and areas where the company can optimize for growth and minimize revenue loss.
 
 🔎 What I did:
 ☑️ Collected and cleaned raw data for accurate analysis.
 ☑️ Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to track ride volume, payment methods, and service performance.
 ☑️ Applied DAX and data modeling to ensure accurate insights.
 ☑️ Created visualizations to highlight customer preferences, weekday vs. weekend trends, and cancellation impact.

♦️Key Insights:
 🚴 Bike rides are the most popular, contributing the highest share of bookings (15K rides).
 💰 Revenue is higher on weekdays (avg. ₹3.6M/day) compared to weekends (₹3M–3.25M).
 💳 Paytm and Amazon Pay dominate as top payment methods (Around11K -12k each).
 ❌ Around 5K cancellations led to significant profit loss — an area for operational improvement.

📌 Tools Used:
 ✅ Power BI
 ✅ DAX
 ✅ Data Modeling
 ✅ Visualization
